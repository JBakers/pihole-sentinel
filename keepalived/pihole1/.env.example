# 1. Copy this file to /etc/keepalived/.env
# 2. Update ALL values below to match your network
#
# Network Configuration
# -------------------
# The following IP addresses are EXAMPLES and must be changed to match your network:
#  - VIP_ADDRESS: The shared IP that both Pi-holes will use (example: 192.168.1.2)
#  - NETWORK_GATEWAY: Your network's gateway/router IP (example: 192.168.1.1)

# Network interface that will handle VRRP traffic
# Check your system's interface name (common names: eth0, ens18, enp3s0)
INTERFACE=eth0

# Virtual IP (VIP) Configuration
# CHANGE THESE to match your network!
VIP_ADDRESS=192.168.1.2          # The shared IP address both Pi-holes will use
VIP_NETMASK=24                   # Typically 24 for /24 subnet
NETWORK_GATEWAY=192.168.1.1      # Your network's gateway/router IP

# Security Configuration
# CRITICAL: Change this to a secure password!
# Must be identical on both Primary and Secondary nodes
VRRP_AUTH_PASS=CHANGE_THIS_PASSWORD

# Node-specific settings
# These can usually stay as-is
NODE_PRIORITY=150                # Higher than backup node
NODE_STATE=MASTER               # This is the primary node
