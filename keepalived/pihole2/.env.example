# Keepalived configuration for Secondary Pi-hole
# ===============================
#
# IMPORTANT: This file contains example values that MUST be changed!
# 1. Copy this file to /etc/keepalived/.env
# 2. Update ALL values below to match your network
# 3. Make sure the values match between Primary and Secondary nodes!
#
# Network Configuration
# -------------------
# The following IP addresses are EXAMPLES and must be changed to match your network:
#  - VIP_ADDRESS: The shared IP that both Pi-holes will use (example: 192.168.1.2)
#  - NETWORK_GATEWAY: Your network's gateway/router IP (example: 192.168.1.1)
#
# NOTE: These values must be identical to those used on the Primary node!

# Network interface that will handle VRRP traffic
# Check your system's interface name (common names: eth0, ens18, enp3s0)
INTERFACE=eth0

# Virtual IP (VIP) Configuration
# CHANGE THESE to match your network!
VIP_ADDRESS=192.168.1.2          # Must match Primary node's VIP
VIP_NETMASK=24                   # Typically 24 for /24 subnet
NETWORK_GATEWAY=192.168.1.1      # Must match Primary node's gateway

# Security Configuration
# CRITICAL: Must be identical to Primary node's password!
VRRP_AUTH_PASS=CHANGE_THIS_PASSWORD

# Node-specific settings
# These should stay as-is unless you have a specific reason to change them
NODE_PRIORITY=100                # Lower than primary node
NODE_STATE=BACKUP               # This is the secondary node
